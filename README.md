Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Innovative Monitoring System for Tele ICU Patients Using Video Processing and Deep Learning. This project aims to enhance patient monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) using advanced video processing techniques and deep learning models.

Introduction:
The Innovative Monitoring System leverages video processing and deep learning to provide real-time monitoring of ICU patients. This system aims to detect and alert medical staff to critical events, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing the workload on healthcare providers.

Features:
Real-time Video Monitoring: Continuously monitors ICU patients using video feeds.
Event Detection: Identifies critical events such as patient movements, falls, or abnormal behavior.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends real-time alerts to medical staff in case of detected anomalies.
Deep Learning Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for accurate event detection.
Data Privacy: Ensures patient data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.
